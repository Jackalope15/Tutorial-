# Understanding Digital Storage Tutorial-
A tutorial of understanding basic Digital Storage by Jack Winters for novice IT Students
========================================================================================
<h1>Basic compomponets of Digital Storage</h1>
<ol>
<li>Capacity- the amount of data the medium can hold</li>
<li>Cost- how expensive the medium costs to create</li>
<li>Access time- the amount of time it takes to access the data on the medium</li>
<li>Read and write speeds- how long the medium takes to read the data and write the data into itself</li>
<li>Stability and reliability- how constantly the medium can do its job</li>
<li>Recoverablity- how easy it is to recover lost data from this medium</li>
<li>Susceptibility- how susceptible the medium is to losing data or having data corrupted</li>
<li>Longevity- how long the medium will still be effective for</li>
<li>Environment- how safe medium is from outside factors like water, chemicals, heat, etc.</li>
<li>Form Factor- The shaped of the medium and how well it can be moved and used in different areas</li>
<li>Obsolescence- how long the medium will be good to be used for before better technology comes and this medium becomes non-practical to use.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Understanding Volitle vs Non-Volitle Storage</h1>
<p>Volatile storage is the type of storage that will store the data until the power on the computer system is turned off. This is stored in the computers RAM (or Random Access Memory). This type of storage is fast but is temporary.</p>
<p>Non-Volatile storage is the type of storage that will save data even after the computer is switched off, so you can reassess the data at a  later time when the computer is switched back on. Inside your computer this type of data will be stored on your hard drive but there are an array of different mediums you can use for non-volatile storage such as: Flashdrives (USBs), Magnetic tapes, Floppy Disks, CDs and DVDs, and much more.</p>
<h1>The Evolution of Digital Storage</h1>
<p>Digital Storage began with the invention of the in-computer hard drive in 1956.  In 1963 the magnetic tape or cassette was created.This began being able to transfer digital data onto a digital storage medium for the first time. Before this was vinyl records but they were created in a press and was not a digital storage media even though it was a data storage medium. Next came the floppy disk i 1971 that allowed saving data and moving from computer to computer with the data on the floppy disk. In 1977 the VHS was invented this was a magnetic tape that allowed storing audio and video. This was the first time this it was available for people to watch things that were not being broadcasted, they also allowed for people to tape television that was being broadcast live to enjoy again at a later date. After this came the CD that was invented by a Japanese inventor in 1982 this was far better then cassette because it did not have to be rewound after to be used again after being listened to. Next in 1995 the DVD was invented and was a step up from the vhs because it didn’t have to be rewound and was more compact and had greater storage. In 1999 the USB flash drive was patented and replaced the floppy disk. The USB operates at a much faster rate, can hold more data, and are less fragile then floppy disks so physical damage is less of a worry. Later in 1999 the first successful forms of cloud storage was executed. Years later this became much more popular and is the most modern and space effective way medium for saving digital data.</p>
<h1>Cloud Storage</h1>
<p>Cloud Storage is the most modern medium for saving digital data. The concept for it came in the 1960’s by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, he came up with the idea for a digital storage medium that all people could connect to and put digital data in. At this time they did not have the technology to make this dream a reality but it gave a rough idea of how modern cloud storage would work. In 1999 the first successful attemp to save to a cloud storage medium was done successfully. It has many advantages for users you can purchase an amount of storage for a year and not have to worry about storage after that, it is also easy to purchase more storage online if its needed. This makes working much more streamline because you can easily add more storage without having to leave the computer. Before this getting more storage would be a difficult task to keep all storage in one place without having to get a hard drive with more space and transferring all previous data onto. The cloud also allows for a company to have everyone save to the same cloud so retrieving others data is a much easier process than having to do it manually with a flash drive. Another advantage is that you have the security of knowing the data will not be erased because of a computer crash or physical damage to a physcial digital storage medium. 
	How does it work? The cloud works from a company with advanced storage equipment storing the data and making it available via online connection to the people that pay to have their data stored their. This data is backed up in multiple ways to ensure that the data is safe and secure so it will not be lost. 
	One disadvantage to Cloud Storage is that it requires online access to retrieve the data so if you have poor connection or no connection it can become difficult or impossible to retrieve the data, a problem that something like a USB does not have.</p>
<h1>Choosing the Best Storage Medium For Your Specific Needs</h1>
<li> Hard Drives - used inside computers for non-volitle storage</li>
<li>Floppy Disks- Outdated now but used to store data and can be moved from computer to computer</li>
<li>Compact Discs (CD’s)- Used for storing audio data</li>
<li>DVD’s- used for storing audio and video</li>
<li>USB’s- A more modern floppy disk and can be used to store data and move from computer to computer</li>
<li>SSD’s- a more modern Hard Drive built into computers for non-volitle storage</li>
<li>SD cards- small flash memory cards that are in smaller devices like your phone, they can have relitvly high amounts of data storage</li>
<li>Icloud Storage- A paid for storage that allows seemless access across multple devices that is paid for on a monthly or yearly basis</li>
